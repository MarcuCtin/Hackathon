# Session Management & Login Implementation

## Overview

Implemented complete session management and login functionality in the frontend, integrated with the onboarding flow.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **AuthProvider Integration**

- Wrapped entire app in `AuthProvider` from `useAuth` hook
- Provides authentication state to all components
- Manages user session via localStorage

### 2. **OnboardingForm Enhancements**

#### Login Flow

- **"Already have an account? Sign in"** button under registration form
- Toggle between login and registration forms
- Separate login form with email and password fields
- After successful login:
  - If user already completed onboarding → redirect to dashboard
  - If user hasn't completed onboarding → start onboarding flow

#### Registration Flow

- Register creates new account
- Moves to onboarding questions
- Saves answers progressively as user completes questions

#### Answer Persistence

- Answers saved to user profile during onboarding
- Goals extracted from answers and saved to profile
- `onboardingAnswers` saved as formatted array
- `completedOnboarding` and `identityComplete` flags set to true

### 3. **API Integration**

#### New API Methods Used

```typescript
// Login
await login(email, password)

// Register
await register(email, password, name)

// Complete onboarding
await api.completeOnboarding({
  onboardingAnswers: string[],
  identityComplete: boolean
})

// Update profile
await api.updateProfile({ goals: string[] })
```

## User Flow

### Scenario 1: New User Registration

1. User sees registration form
2. Enters name, email, password
3. Clicks "Create Account"
4. Account created, moved to onboarding questions
5. Answers 7 wellness questions
6. On completion, answers saved to profile
7. Redirected to dashboard

### Scenario 2: Existing User Login

1. User clicks "Already have an account? Sign in"
2. Enters email and password
3. Clicks "Sign In"
4. Two outcomes:
   - **Completed onboarding**: Redirected to dashboard
   - **Incomplete onboarding**: Continues onboarding from where they left off

### Scenario 3: Skip Without Account

1. User clicks "Skip for now"
2. Goes directly to dashboard without creating account
3. Limited functionality (no data persistence)

## Technical Details

### State Management

```typescript
// Auth state
const { isAuthenticated, user, login, register } = useAuth();

// Form state
const [showLogin, setShowLogin] = useState(false);
const [isLoggingIn, setIsLoggingIn] = useState(false);
const [isRegistering, setIsRegistering] = useState(false);
```

### Answer Processing

- Answers filtered to extract goals (excludes emotional states)
- Formatted as `questionId: value` pairs
- Max 5 goals saved to profile
- Full answer set saved in `onboardingAnswers`

### Profile Updates

When onboarding completes:

1. Goals extracted and saved
2. `onboardingAnswers` array saved
3. `completedOnboarding: true`
4. `identityComplete: true`

## Files Modified

1. **OnboardingForm.tsx**

   - Added login functionality
   - Integrated with useAuth hook
   - Added answer persistence
   - Toggle between login/register forms

2. **main.tsx**

   - Wrapped app in AuthProvider
   - Imports useAuth hook

3. **useAuth.tsx** (already existed)

   - Provides authentication context
   - Manages session state

4. **api.ts** (already existed)
   - Contains API methods for auth
   - Handles token management

## Testing the Flow

### Register New User

```bash
# Open app
# Fill registration form
# Click "Create Account"
# Complete onboarding questions
# Verify profile updated
```

### Login Existing User

```bash
# Open app
# Click "Already have an account? Sign in"
# Enter credentials
# Click "Sign In"
# Redirected to dashboard or continue onboarding
```

## API Endpoints Used

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new account
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Sign in
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

### Profile

- `PUT /api/profile` - Update profile (goals)
- `POST /api/profile/onboarding/complete` - Complete onboarding

## Security Features

1. **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters
2. **Email Validation**: Type="email" validation
3. **Token Management**: Stored in localStorage
4. **Protected Routes**: Require authentication

## Error Handling

- Registration failures show toast error
- Login failures show credential error
- Profile update failures show error but continue flow
- Network errors handled gracefully

## Next Steps

1. Add "Forgot Password" functionality
2. Add email verification
3. Add remember me option
4. Add biometric login
5. Add OAuth providers (Google, Apple)
6. Add session timeout handling
